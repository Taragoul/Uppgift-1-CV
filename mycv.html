          2018-2019 Karolinska Sjukhuset : Worked as a team member within
          Service and Logistics at Karolinska with various job roles. I started
          at Konferensservice as Customer Service and booking/janitor duties
          within NKS and relocation assistance from old Karolinska's premises to
          new ones. Then worked as a Service Host for the administrative side of
          Karolinska in the Elite hotel Carolina Tower with everything from IT
          help/orders to cleaning surfaces. Most recently, I worked at
          Sängverkstaden where we troubleshooted various beds/wheelchairs etc.
          and if we could fix them, we did so or we had to roll out new
          replacements.
